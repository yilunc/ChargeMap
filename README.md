####Pebble App

Provides drivers with a list of the nearest charging stations for their electric vehicle based on their location. It provides the most important information like connector type, address, and hours of operation.

Once the locate button is pressed, users can choose from the three closest charging ports sorted by distance. Drivers can then select to see more details about each charging port in order to find the one that is most convenient for the driver.
